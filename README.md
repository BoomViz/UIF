# UIF ([Unturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/) Id Finder)
Program developed for game [Unturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/) for finding ids by name, category, etc. and get item information

## Inaccuracies
Some values may be inaccurate because servers can set their own multipliers of protection, damage, etc.

## Screenshots
You can find [screenshots here](README/screenshots.md)

## How can I get started?
1. Open the "Folders select" menu
2. Click the "Plus" button
3. Add a folder with mods that are on the disk where Unturned is installed (E.g. `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\304930`). To display the linked items correctly, you also need to add a folder with standard items (E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Unturned\Bundles`)
4. Clear the `...\workshop\content\304930` folder
5. Restart Unturned (or run)
6. Connect to the server
7. Explore!
